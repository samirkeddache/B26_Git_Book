Algeria is a North African country with a Mediterranean coastline and a Saharan desert interior.
 Many empires have left legacies here, such as the ancient Roman ruins in seaside Tipaza. In the capital,
 Algiers, Ottoman landmarks like circa-1612 Ketchaoua Mosque line the hillside Casbah quarter, with its narrow alleys and stairways.
The city’s Neo-Byzantine basilica Notre Dame d’Afrique dates to French colonial rule.
